# Olah Kata
Olah Kata is an online Scrabble or TextTwist solver for Indonesian/English.

Olah Kata is created using Free Pascal as the back-end CGI application. You may look it goes live [here](http://beeography.koding.io/olahkata.cgi) at [Bee's Koding account](http://beeography.koding.io). But because it's a ***free*** Koding account, it doesn't always up. :)

Feel free to fork. Enjoy!
